==== Context

Software should be documented in a widely used and standardized way. We use `arc42` this format. For writing the documentation we had to decide between `markdown` and `asciidoc`. `markdown` is a widely known easy to understand format and is readable without a renderer, it lacks configuration for text. `asciidoc` on the other hand has a great configuration for text, is standardized and a many different plugins to support basically everything.

==== Decision

We decided to favor `asciidoc` over `markdown` because it is standardized, has more features while being almost as simple as `markdown`. 

==== Consequences

As of today, we rarely used `markdown` in any documentation, so the impact in migration is neglectible. Current `markdown` documentation does not need to be updated, but it would be highly appreciated to do so.
